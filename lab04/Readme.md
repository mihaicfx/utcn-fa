# Assignment No. 4: Merge k Ordered Lists Efficiently

## Implementation

You are required to implement correctly and efficiently an O(nâ‹…logk) method for merging k sorted sequences, where n is the total number of elements. (Hint: use a heap, see seminar no. 2 notes).

Implementation requirements:
- Use linked lists to represent the k sorted sequences and the output sequence

## Minimal requirements for grading
- Prepare a demo for each algorithm implemented.
- Interpret the charts and write your observations in the header (block comments) section at the beginning of your main .cpp file.
- We do not accept assignments without code indentation and with code not organized in functions (for example where the entire code is in the main function).
- The points from the requirements correspond to a correct and complete solution, quality of interpretation from the block comment and the correct answer to the questions from the teacher.


## Requirements

### 1. Generate k randomly sized sorted lists (having n elements in total, n and k given as parameters) and the merging of 2 lists (5p)

You will have to show your algorithm (generation and merging) works on a small-sized input (e.g. k=4, n=20).

### 2. Adapt min-heap operations to work on the new structure (3p)
You will have to show your algorithm (merging) works on a small-sized input (e.g. k=4, n=20).

### 3. Evaluation of the algorithm in average case (2p)

! Before you start to work on the algorithm's evaluation code, make sure you have a correct algorithm!

We will make the average case analysis of the algorithm. Remember that, in the average case, you have to repeat the measurements several times. Since both k and n may vary, we will make each analysis in turn:

- Choose, in turn, 3 constant values for k (k1=5, k2=10, k3=100); generate k random sorted lists for each value of k so that the number of elements in all the lists n varies between 100 and 10000, with a maximum increment of 400 (we suggest 100); run the algorithm for all values of n (for each value of k); generate a chart that represents the sum of assignments and comparisons done by the merging algorithm for each value of k as a curve (total 3 curves).

- Set n = 10.000; the value of k must vary between 10 and 500 with an increment of 10; generate k random sorted lists for each value of k so that the number of elements in all the lists is 10000; test the merging algorithm for each value of k and generate a chart that represents the sum of assignments and comparisons as a curve.
